# Hangman Game (Python)

📌 Description
This project is a simple text-based Hangman game developed in Python as part of the CodeAlpha's Python Programming Internship Task.  
The player guesses a hidden word one letter at a time. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of allowed incorrect attempts.

🎯 Features
- Uses a predefined list of words
- Randomly selects a secret word
- Allows one-letter guesses at a time
- Limits incorrect guesses to 6
- Displays already guessed letters
- Simple console-based interaction

🧠 Concepts Used
- Python basics
- `random` module
- `while` loop
- `if-else` conditions
- Strings and lists
- User input and output
