Task 1: Hangman Game

🎯 Goal

The goal is to create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.

📌 Description

This project is a simple text-based Hangman game developed in Python as part of the CodeAlpha's Python Programming Internship Task.  
The player guesses a hidden word one letter at a time. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of allowed incorrect attempts.

🧩 Features
- Uses a predefined list of words
- Randomly selects a secret word
- Allows one-letter guesses at a time
- Limits incorrect guesses to 6
- Displays already guessed letters
- Simple console-based interaction

🧠 Concepts Used
- Python basics
- `random` module
- `while` loop
- `if-else` conditions
- Strings and lists
- User input and output

▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file named `hangman.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python hangman.py

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple text-based Hangman game using Python fundamentals.  
Through this task, core programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, strings, lists, and user input handling were applied effectively.  
The project helped strengthen logical thinking and provided hands-on experience in building an interactive console application, making it a valuable learning exercise as part of the CodeAlpha Python Internship.

Task 2: Basic Rule-Based Chatbot

🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to build a simple rule-based chatbot that interacts with users using predefined responses based on specific inputs.

📖 Description

This chatbot is a beginner-friendly Python program that simulates a basic conversation with the user.
It works by matching user inputs with predefined rules using conditional statements (if-elif-else).
The chatbot continues the conversation until the user types "bye".

🧩 Scope

Accepts user inputs such as:
hello, hi, hey
how are you
what is your name
help
thank you, thanks
bye

Responds with predefined replies.

Runs continuously using a loop until the user exits.

🛠️ Key Concepts Used

Functions – to encapsulate chatbot logic

`if-elif-else statements` – for rule-based responses

`while loop` – for continuous interaction

`input() and print()` – for Input / Output 

`.lower()` – for String Hnadling typically to avoid case sensitivity

💻 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Environment: Any Python-supported IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.)

▶️ How to Run the Program

1.Make sure Python is installed on your system.

2.Copy the code into a file named chatbot.py.

3.Open a terminal or command prompt.

4.Run the program using:
   `python chatbot.py`

Start chatting with the chatbot!

🧪 Sample Interaction

🤖 Chatbot: Hello!

You: hello

🤖 Chatbot: Hi! How may I help you?

You: how are you

🤖 Chatbot: I'm fine, thanks!

You: bye

🤖 Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a nice day.

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of rule-based chatbots using Python.
It is suitable for beginners and serves as a strong foundation for learning more advanced chatbot concepts in the future.
